# Installer for Essential Tools

## Background
Sometimes, switching from one environment to another can be tedious and exhausting, especially when I have to repeatedly install the essential tools I regularly use. To solve this issue, I created a script that automates the installation of these important tools. This not only saves me time and effort but also ensures that my preferred tools are ready to use in any new environment.

## Usage
```
sudo su 
curl -sSL https://github.com/justakazh/IET/raw/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Improvement 
This script currently installs all the tools by default. In the future, I plan to improve it by adding an installation menu that allows users to choose which tools they want to install. This will make the process more flexible and efficient, especially when only specific tools are needed. Feel free to contribute!
